# 30 Minutes of Code
This repository is a small notebook for me a to play around with different python programming practices and concepts.

## Subdirectories
* **knowledge\_library:** Snippets of code that I wrote to test out different concepts.
* **daily\_challenges:** Practice programming challenges.

## Executing Scripts
Read the description prefacing each module to learn how to interact with it.  
*For Example: `python <my_module.py> [<argumnents>]`*

## Running the Tests
`python <my_module_test.py>`

## Acknowledgments
